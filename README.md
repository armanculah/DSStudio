# Data Structures Studio
An interactive learning platform for experimenting with fundamental data structures through SVG-powered visualizations and a FastAPI backend.

## TODO
- Polish the new landing hero with illustrations and testimonials.
- Finish queue, array, BST, and heap visualizers plus their saving logic.
- Add richer saved-visualization management (tags, filtering, preview playback).
- Expand the educational copy with more examples, quizzes, and glossary entries.
- Harden backend profile features (picture upload validation, audit trail UI).
